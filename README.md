Get average reputation from Stack Exchange websites
===================================================

The aim of this Chrome plugin is to see the average reputation/day a user gained for a certain period. Example:

 1. Visit: [John Skeet's profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656?tab=reputationhistory)

 3. Click the button and *magic* happens!
